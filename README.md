What Iâ€™ve Done So Far

Installed and configured Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB
Set up local environments and verified database connections
Created synthetic datasets for:
    customers
    products
    orders
    order_items
    transactions
Stored datasets in data/raw/
Added basic docs for future AI/RAG use:
    faq.md
    romo_guidelines.md

Its main objective is to help students set up essential tools, work with databases, manage data pipelines, and integrate AI tooling within a structured workflow.
Through this bootcamp, I will:
Set up a complete developer environment (Python, Node.js, Git, Databases)
Work with synthetic datasets (customers, products, orders, transactions)
Practice data handling, cleaning, and basic analysis
Learn to use version control (Git + GitHub) for project tracking
Experiment with AI and GenAI integrations (OpenAI SDK, Ollama)
Document the process for reproducibility and team collaboration

1. installed db, llms, py libraries
2. created a repo
3. created a vir env 
4. created postgres, mongodb table and checked connection
5. pushed everything into git
6. created synthetic datasets
