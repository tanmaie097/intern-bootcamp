üß© 1. Top-Spending Customers (using a CTE)
Find the top 3 customers who spent the most money across all orders.
üí° Hint:
Use a CTE to calculate total_spent per customer (sum of quantity * unit_price).
Then, select the top 3 from that CTE using ORDER BY total_spent DESC LIMIT 3

with total_spent as (
    select orders.customer_id, sum(quantity*unit_price) as spent_money from order_items
    join orders on orders.order_id = order_items.order_id
    group by orders.customer_id
) select * from total_spent order by total_spent desc limit 3;

üß© 2. High-Value Orders (using a subquery)
List all orders whose total value is above the average order value.
üí° Hint:
Inner query ‚Üí compute the average total_price across all orders.
Outer query ‚Üí filter orders whose total is greater than that average.
